Microservices architectures are inherently distributed and building such solutions always bring interesting challenges to the table: resilient service invocation, distributed transactions, on-demand scaling, idempotent message processing and more.

Deploying Microservices on Kubernetes doesnâ€™t solve these problems and Developers need to learn and use SDK's on top of frameworks such as .NET, while building distributed Microservices architectures.

This session (Spanish) will show developers how  to overcome such challenges using .NET and Dapr: a portable runtime to build distributed, scalable, and event-driven microservices.
