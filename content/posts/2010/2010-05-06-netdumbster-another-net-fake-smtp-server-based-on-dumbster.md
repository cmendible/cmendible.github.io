Today I've released **netDumbster** (<http://netdumbster.codeplex.com/>)

**netDumbster** is a .Net Fake SMTP Server clone of the popular **Dumbster** (<http://quintanasoft.com/dumbster/>)

**netDumbster** is based on the API of **nDumbster** (<http://ndumbster.sourceforge.net/default.html>) and the nice C# Email Server (CSES) writen by Eric Daugherty.

Hope it helps!!!

**Update:** **netDumbster** source code was moved to a GitHub repo: [https://github.com/cmendible/netDumbster](https://github.com/cmendible/netDumbster)
