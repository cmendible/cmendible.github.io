title: Use Azure Media Services to Find Filler Words
---
On April 22 I had the great opportunity to give a talk on Azure Functions in the Global Azure Bootcamp hosted in Madrid. I had a great time, but weeks later when the video was published I realised that I was using a filler word way to much through my presentation.

My ears were hurting and then came the need to know how many times I said the word. So I took this as an opportunity to learn a bit about Azure Media Services.

The following gif will show you to **Use Azure Media Services to Find Filler Words** without any automation, just using the portal and a text editor such as Visual Studio Code.

The results showed that I used the word"vale" (Ok in Spain) a total of **289 times**, almost an average of **6 per min**. So yes I do have to improve my skills as a speaker and yes Media Services rocks!.

This is the video of my talk (In spanish): [Track 2 Sesi√≥n 7 -Azure Functions: Hasta la vista Server](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Microsoft-Spain-Events/Azure-Bootcamp-Madrid/Track-2-Sesin-7-Azure-Functions-Hasta-la-vista-Server)

Hope it helps!
