Four months ago I cleared the **PMP** exam as part of a program launched by <a href="https://twitter.com/sogetispain" target="_blank">@SogetiSpain</a> and I want to share with you that the book: **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/PMP-Rapid-Review-Sean-Whitaker/dp/0735664404" target="_blank">&#8220;PMP Rapid Review" by Sean Whitaker</a>** was key to success.

    "<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMP?src=hash">#PMP</a> Rapid Review" by <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanWhitakerPM">@SeanWhitakerPM</a> was like an ETL placed between the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMBOK?src=hash">#PMBOK</a> & my brain. Guess what? I cleared the exam! cc <a href="https://twitter.com/MSLearning">@MSLearning</a>

Many books are structured by Knowledge Areas defined in the <a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx" target="_blank">PMBOK Guide</a> but not by the <a href="https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwimksiMs6DLAhXFtRoKHRmLDLkQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pmi.org%2FCertification%2FProject-Management-Professional-PMP%2F~%2Fmedia%2FPDF%2FCertifications%2FPMP_Examination_Content_Outline_Aug.ashx&usg=AFQjCNEkvPM59ySj3WbdutaQtiV30QerWQ&bvm=bv.115339255,d.ZWU" target="_blank">PMP Exam Content Outline</a> as"PMP Rapid Review" does.

Reading the book you'll find one chapter for each Process Group:

1. Initiating the project
2. Planning the project
3. Executing the project
4. Monitoring and controlling the project
5. Closing the project

and also that it's a great and interesting resource because:

* It's really easy to follow.
* It's not a full and cumbersome study guide.
* It's a book published by <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Press</a>
* Each section contains some exam tips and five questions designed to make you understand the PMP processes and concepts.

    Today I cleared the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMP?src=hash">#PMP</a> exam without memorizing the ITTO. My advice: understand each process otherwise you'll waste your time and money!

In my opinion this book is a must have, both as a quick guide when studying and as a checklist once you become a PMP.

Hope it helps!
