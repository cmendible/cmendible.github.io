I recently passed the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-534.aspx" target="_blank">70-534 Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions</a> exam, and I want to share with you tips about the exam and the resources I used to study:

**Should you take the exam?**

If you are a **Solutions or Software Architect** looking to validate your <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure </a>skills then this exam is for you. Also note that Microsoft expects you to:

  * Know the features and capabilities of Azure services to be able to design cloud solutions.
  * Be able to define the appropriate infrastructure and platform solutions to meet the required functional, operational and deployment requirements through the solution life cycle.

**Skills measured:**

  * Design Microsoft Azure infrastructure and networking (15-20%)
  * Secure resources (15-20%)
  * Design an application storage and data access strategy (15-20%)
  * Design an advanced application (15-20%)
  * Design websites (15-20%)
  * Design a management, monitoring, and business continuity strategy (15-20%)

**Books:**

  * <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/exam-ref-70-534-architecting-microsoft-azure-solutions-9780735697447" target="_blank">Exam Ref 70-534 Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions</a> as all Exam Ref books it's an important resource for studying but it's not a complete Training Guide so reading and practicing with other resources is important.
  * <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/ebooks#azure" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Essentials: Fundamentals of Azure</a> a book you can find in the <a href="http://mva.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Virtual Academy</a> along with many other free e-books

**Courses:**

The <a href="http://mva.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Virtual Academy</a> is a place filled with great training material and best of all it's free! Here is the list of courses I completed before the exam:

  * <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/training-courses/architecting-microsoft-azure-solutions" target="_blank">Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions</a>
  * <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/training-courses/get-started-with-windows-azure-today-jump-start" target="_blank">Get Started with Windows Azure Today Jump Start</a>
  * <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/training-courses/the-microsoft-hybrid-cloud-best-practices-guidance" target="_blank">The Microsoft Hybrid Cloud: Best Practices Guidance</a>
  * <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/training-courses/windows-azure-iaas-deep-dive-jump-start" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure IaaS Deep Dive Jump Start</a>
  * <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/training-courses/establish-microsoft-azure-iaas-technical-fundamentals" target="_blank">Establish Microsoft Azure IaaS Technical Fundamentals</a>

**Practice tests:**

Just like for any certification exam, studying with practice tests is key to success.

  * <a href="http://www.measureup.com/70-534-Architecting-Microsoft-Azure-Solutions-P5528.aspx" target="_blank">MesureUp 70-534 Practice Test</a>: contains 150 questions and I really like the new online format!

**Hands On:**

Be sure to get some hands on experience!

  * For instance I can tell you that I'm not a great Powershell fan so I had to open the console and start playing and trying the commands in order to learn and understand them.
  * Coming from the **Dev** side of the world I really took time to play with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-network/" target="_blank">Virtual Networks</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-acl/" target="_blank">ACL</a>&#8216;s and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-nsg/" target="_blank">NSG</a>&#8216;s

Hope it helps!
