Yesterday I cleared the **<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-532.aspx" target="_blank">70-532 Develping Microsoft Azure Solutions </a>**exam, and I want to share with you tips about the exam and the resources I used to study:

**Should you take the exam?**

If you are a **Developer** **or Software Architect** looking to validate your <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure </a>skills then this exam is for you. Also note that Microsoft expects you to:

  * Be proficient with Azure development tools and techniques.
  * Have experience developing scalable and resilient solutions with Azure.

**Skills measured:**

  * Design and implement websites (15-20%)
  * Create and manage virtual machines (20-25%)
  * Design and implement cloud services (20-25%)
  * Design and implement a storage strategy (20-25%)
  * Manage application and network services (15-20%)

**Books:**

  * **<a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/exam-ref-70-532-developing-microsoft-azure-solutions-9780735697041" target="_blank">Exam Ref 70-532 Develping Microsoft Azure Solutions</a>** as all Exam Ref books it's an important resource for studying but it's not a complete Training Guide so reading and practicing with other resources is important.
  * <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/ebooks#azure" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Essentials: Fundamentals of Azure</a> and <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/ebooks#azure" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Essentials Azure Web Apps for Developers</a>, both great introductory books that you can find in the <a href="http://mva.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Virtual Academy</a> along with many other free e-books

**Courses:**

The <a href="http://mva.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Virtual Academy</a> is a place filled with great training material and best of all it's free! Here is the list of courses I completed before the exam:

  * <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/developing-microsoft-azure-solutions-8481" target="_blank">Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions</a>
  * <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-8391" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Fundamentals</a>
  * <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-websites-8460" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: WebSites</a>

**Practice tests:**

Just like for any certification exam, studying with practice tests is key to success.

  * <a href="http://www.measureup.com/Developing-Microsoft-Azure-Solutions-P5566.aspx" target="_blank">MesureUp 70-532 Practice Test</a>: contains 152 questions.

**Hands On:**

Be sure to get some hands on experience!

  * Learn those PowerShell commands and don't forget that Azure CLI does exists.
  * Developing <a href="https://github.com/cmendible/AzureBus" target="_blank">AzureBus</a> was key to understand and master <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions/" target="_blank">Azure Service Bus Topics, Queues and Subscriptions</a> concepts.
  * I also created my own storage samples to get experience with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1/" target="_blank">Shared Access Signatures (SAS)</a> and custom policies.

Hope it helps!
